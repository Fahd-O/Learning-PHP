# Learning PHP Repository  

This repository contains a collection of PHP scripts and projects I created while learning PHP using tutorial videos by **Dani Krossing** on YouTube. It documents my journey to understand and master PHP programming, covering both foundational concepts and practical applications. A wide range of topics were covered, including:

- PHP basics like variables, operators, and control structures.  
- Advanced concepts like session management, database interaction, and error handling.  
- Practical applications, such as login systems, contact forms, and image galleries.

Created and completed between 23rd Dec 2021 and 23rd Feb 2022.

## Repository Overview  

### Purpose

This repository serves as a practice ground for implementing the concepts demonstrated in the tutorial videos. Each file corresponds to a specific episode from Dani Krossing’s tutorial series. The numbering of each file reflects the tutorial episode, so there are no missing files—each file directly maps to a lesson taught in the series.
