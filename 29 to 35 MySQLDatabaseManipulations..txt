create table post

insert into post (subject, content, date) values ('This is the subject', 'This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content This is the content.', '2022-07-25 11:09:02');

insert into post (subject, content, date) values ('This is the 2nd subject', 'This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content This is 2nd content .', '2022-07-25 11:25:58');

SELECT * subject 

SELECT * subject WHERE id=‘1’
